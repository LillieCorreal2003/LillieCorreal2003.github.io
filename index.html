When she was younger, she attended classes at NC State University with a program, "TechGirlz". This is when she really began to become interested in technology and the engineering field. She has always possessed good organization and communication skills in school. She has always been comfortable communicating with others which would be very effective if she were to be working with others in groups consistently. She would like to obtain an internship to learn and gain exposure in a professional engineering workplace.</p>
